I'm totally going to end up leaking some user creds through this. Maybe I should just fork over the cashmonies for a github account with private repos ;-)

I'm sticking my shared things in here, then symlinking from where the app expects to find this. Or I could probably just use dropbox for automatic syncing, but this way it's easier to share.
